## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to computational thinking, data science, and programming techniques essential for modern civil engineering practice. Students will learn Python programming fundamentals, data manipulation with NumPy and Pandas, data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning applications in civil engineering contexts. The course emphasizes practical skills for analyzing engineering data, automating calculations, and developing computational solutions for civil engineering problems.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Master Python programming fundamentals for engineering applications
2. Use NumPy and Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis
3. Create effective data visualizations for engineering data
4. Apply statistical methods to analyze engineering datasets
5. Implement machine learning techniques for civil engineering problems
6. Develop computational solutions for structural analysis and design
7. Communicate technical results through code documentation and presentations

## Required Materials

- **Primary:** Course lecture notebooks (provided in this repository)
- **Reference Book 1:** VanderPlas, J. *A Whirlwind Tour of Python* (included in `book1_python_handbook/`)
- **Reference Book 2:** VanderPlas, J. *Python Data Science Handbook* (included in `book2_datascience_handbook/`)
- **Software:** Python 3.10+, Jupyter Notebook, required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- **IDE:** [Cursor](https://cursor.com/), VS Code, or any IDE of your choice with AI/LLM integration
- **AI Tools:** Students are encouraged to set up LLM-powered coding assistants (e.g., Claude Code, Gemini CLI) to support their workflow

## Grading

| Component | Weight |
|---|---|
| Weekly Labs | 30% |
| Midterm Exam | 25% |
| Final Project | 35% |
| Class Participation | 10% |

**Laboratory Presentation Policy:** For each lab session, 3 students will be randomly selected to present their work. Students who are selected but fail to present will receive 0 points for the presentation component of that lab.

## Course Schedule

| Week | Topic | Notebook |
|------|-------|----------|
| 1 | **Python Fundamentals & Data Science Lifecycle** — Syntax, variables, data types, control structures (self-study); data science lifecycle (in-class) | `Week01_Python_Fundamentals/` |
| 2 | **Python Modules & Data Science** — Functions, modules, intro to data science libraries | `Week02_Python_Modules_and_Data_Science/` |
| 3 | **NumPy & Pandas** — Array operations, DataFrames, data manipulation | `Week03_NumPy_Pandas/` |
| 4 | **Data Visualization** — Matplotlib, plotting, visualization thinking | `Week04_Matplotlib_Visualization/` |
| 5 | **Statistical Analysis** — Descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, regression | `Week05_Statistical_Analysis/` |
| 6 | **Machine Learning Introduction** — Supervised learning, model evaluation | `Week06_Machine_Learning_Introduction/` |
| 7 | **Naive Bayes** — Probabilistic classification, text classification | `Week07_Naive_Bayes/` |
| 8 | **Support Vector Machines** — SVM classification, kernel methods | `Week08_Support_Vector_Machines/` |
| 9-12 | **Final Project** — Group data science project with civil engineering focus (max 3 members, topics TBD) | |

## Homework Policy

- Homework will be assigned weekly and due at the beginning of class
- Late submissions: 10% penalty per day (maximum 3 days)
- Collaboration is encouraged but each student must write their own code
- All code must be properly documented and commented
- Submit Jupyter notebooks as required

## Laboratory Policy

- Labs are hands-on programming sessions applying weekly concepts
- Lab reports must be submitted within one week of the lab session
- For each lab, 3 students will be randomly selected to present their solutions
- Lab work should be individual unless explicitly stated as group work

## Exam Policy

- **Midterm:** In-class, computer-based
- **Final Project:** Group project (max 3 members, Weeks 9-12), topics TBD, must demonstrate integration of course concepts
- One page (both sides) of handwritten notes allowed for midterm
- No makeup exams except for documented emergencies

## Academic Integrity

Students are expected to:
- Complete all assignments independently unless explicitly stated otherwise
- Properly cite all sources and references, including online code repositories
- Not share solutions with other students
- Acknowledge any AI assistance used in coding assignments

Violations will result in disciplinary action as per university policy.

## Additional Resources

- **Software Installation:** [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) distribution recommended
- **Online Resources:** [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
